# Batchelor-Monkey-Puzzle-Website
This website documents the fascinating journey of a dozen little Monkey Puzzle
seeds collected from a local New Zealand park, as they progress into seedlings. 

AlphaDev v1.0.3 - 9th August 2024
- All other CSS files other than "main.css" have been removed
    The following CSS files have been removed:
    - chingford.css
    - seedlings.css
    - about.css
    - seedlings2.css
    - seeds.css
- Before deleting the 5 other CSS files, some class/id's were merged into main.css, which
all webpages on this website are now linked to. From this day forth, the 6 webpages on the 
Batchelor Monkey Puzzle Website will be linked to main.css
- For each webpage, there will be:
    - a large black title header, containing the header
    in white Georgia-style font
    - Paragraph's with a white background, and a black-greenish border, with left aligned Segoue UI text
    - Images outside of paragraphs will be centered, and will now have thin green borders outlining them
    - Images within paragraphs will be positioned to the left of the white background,
    and will have a light black border around them.
- For the Chingford Park page, the four images below the first paragraph,
  will be surrounded by a light-yellow background with a black-greenish border.
  And at the bottom there will be text describing the images.
- Removed most of the <hr> line breaks and line breaks will now be placed above the
  Copyright banner at the bottom of each page
    - Except on the main page, there is a line break just below the white nav menu,
    that contains the "Contents", "About Me" and "Extras" buttons.
- The "Contents" and "Extras" buttons drop-down lists, now have their text
  aligned to the left now, instead of the center.
